## Overview

Vision Transformers have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional convolutional neural networks by leveraging the Transformer architecture originally designed for natural language processing. This repository’s `vit.ipynb` notebook guides you through:
- **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** How to load your dataset and apply necessary image transformations.
- **Model Definition:** Building the Vision Transformer architecture using PyTorch.
- **Training Pipeline:** Setting up the training loop, defining loss functions, and optimizing the model.
- **Evaluation & Visualization:** Analyzing the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy and visualizing training progress.

## Features

- **End-to-End Implementation:** From data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- **Customizable Hyperparameters:** Easily modify learning rate, number of epochs, batch size, etc.
- **Visualization Tools:** Built-in plots for training loss, accuracy, and sample predictions.
- **Modular Code:** Organized sections in the notebook make it simple to understand and extend.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (latest version recommended)
- [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

> **Note:** For faster training, ensure you have a CUDA-enabled GPU and the corresponding CUDA toolkit installed.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vision-transformer.git
   cd vision-transformer
## Usage
Launch the Notebook: Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab in the repository directory:

```bash
jupyter notebook vit.ipynb
```
Follow the Notebook Steps:

- Data Loading: Import and inspect your dataset.
- Preprocessing: Apply necessary transformations such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- Model Definition: Understand and modify the Vision Transformer architecture as needed.
- Training: Configure hyperparameters (e.g., number of epochs, learning rate) and run the training loop.
- Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics and visualizations provided in the notebook.

### Customization:
- Change dataset paths or parameters to experiment with different setups.
- Modify the architecture or training settings to fine-tune performance.

## Results
- After executing the notebook, you can expect to see:

- Training Metrics: Loss and accuracy curves over the epochs, illustrating the learning progress.
- Evaluation Results: Detailed metrics such as overall accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
- Sample Predictions: Visual comparisons between the model's predictions and true labels to assess its performance qualitatively.
